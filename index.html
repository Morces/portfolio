      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <div class="edu">
        <p>
          I graduated from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and <br>
        Technology with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Analytical Chemistry. <br>
        I then joined Moringa School for a course in Web Development as <br>
        this has always been my passion. I am good at it because I give <br>
        it my all and do it from the bottom of my heart. I believe learning <br>
        coding has no end with the diversity and dynamicity of programming, <br>
        so I am an individual who loves learning, both from peers and also from <br>
        other sources. I have no experience in web Development as a job, <br>
        but I am really looking forward to it. <br>
        <br>
        I am a strong believer in teamwork because as they say, unity is strength. <br>
        My major interests and hobbies are currently travelling, socializing, <br>
        and watching documentaries. <br>
        <br>
        Apart from coding, I have a digital badge in Introduction to CyberSecurity <br>
        and Networking Essentials.
